*** For the Binary Clock project ***

The LEDs used in this project were set into a breadboard.

The BASYS 3 Pmods were used to drive the LEDs.

4 LEDs for the hour
6 LEDs for the minute
1 LED for the second's blinker

11 LEDs total, including a 330 ohm resistor for each.

This clock project is one of the projects presented in my upcoming Verilog tutorial book.
