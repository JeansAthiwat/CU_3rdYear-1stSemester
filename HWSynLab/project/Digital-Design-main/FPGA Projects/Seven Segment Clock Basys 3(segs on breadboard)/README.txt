*** For the 7-segment display clock ***

The four 7-segment displays used in this design are of common cathode and were set into a breadboard. 

The segments were driven by BASYS 3 Pmods as well as a ground connection to Pmod. 

Two red LEDs were used as the seconds blinker, also driven by Pmod. 

The four cathodes were each connected to ground through a 330 ohm resistor. 

The buttons for setting the hour and minute are on the BASYS 3 itself. 

This project is one of the digital clock projects presented in my upcoming Verilog tutorial book.
