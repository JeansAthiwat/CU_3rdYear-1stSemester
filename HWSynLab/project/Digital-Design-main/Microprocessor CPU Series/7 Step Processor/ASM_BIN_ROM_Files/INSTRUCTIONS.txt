1. Write an assembly program and save it using the .asm file extension.

2. Assemble the program.
	(For Windows)
	a. Open the folder containing the .asm file.
	b. Open a separate folder containing the assembler program.
	c. Drag and drop the .asm file onto the assembler program icon.
	(For Linux)
	a. 
* You should now see a .bin file of the same name as the .asm file.

3. Generate a rom.v file for the CPU instructions in the .bin file.
	a. Open the bin2rom.py file in a text editor.
	b. Set the program_name variable equal to the program name.
	c. Save the file.
	d. Open a command prompt terminal.
	e. Navigate to the directory containing the bin2rom.py program.
	f. Ensure the .bin file to be processed is in this directory.
	g. Run the bin2rom.py file at the command prompt: py bin2rom.py
* You should now see a Verilog file named program_name_rom.v in the folder.
* Use the rom Test Bench rom_TB.v to verify the ROM (if you want to).

4. Configure the CPU Initialization module for the ROM.
	a. Open the cpu_init.v file in a text editor.
	b. Edit the name of the _rom.v file for the ROM module instantiation.

* This completes the instructions for how to prepare a program for CPU_B.
