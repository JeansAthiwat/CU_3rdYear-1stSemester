*** Below is a list of books that I have on my bookshelf for Digital Design and/or Verilog/SystemVerilog/VHDL and/or Computer Architecture***
*** I have collected these books in search of knowledge and wisdom in Digital Design, HDLs, and FPGAs ***
*** A couple of these books were required textbooks for college, most others were purchased by me, mostly from Ebay or Amazon ***
